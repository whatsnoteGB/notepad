a summary over the 45 days of GB (jan 14th - feb 28th) 
  
- i (sometimes) love your desperate acts of compulsion as saying 'i love you' just two hours after we met in person (what?)(i answered "me too i guess" but at that point i confess i wasn't actually trying to guess anymore)
- i love how i'm able to completely rest if you're by my side because i don't have to imagine what you're doing or watching, just fully enjoy being with you
- i love your little gestures to show some valuing because those are so next to the motions i would do too; as the soda lemon you brought me to joke about our compatibility and i kept the two bottle caps in that little box as if they were compromise rings
- i love how we're forever, no matter what, bonded over an inescapable subject such as racing and cars, even if we eventually became enemies there will be always some memory being deeply brought up in our brains when someone raises anything concerning those passions and it will perpetually be a silent mention about us that NOBODY will ever catch
- i love how you listen to things you don't enjoy listening to/knowing about exactly in the same physical position I do (resting, with an arm under the head and the other one front guarding your chest) because of how the jealousy of our pasts hurts us equally; (a body language that matches so much i'm even shy by knowing you might know what i'm feeling sometimes) 
- i love how you must be smiling and rosing cheeks after reading the item above for the first time because you probably didn't notice that before but ye, that's precisely how we do it 
- i love how warm your body is to the point i can barely distinct if you cummed because there's almost no temperature variance
- i love how i can tell you about anything and ask about anything and we're openbook to each other, not just because we got no reason to lie but also because we have this terrible urge to test each other's reaction to things (an adventurous and dangerous trace we share, by the way) -- you're smiling again?
- i love dreaming about living with you in a very quiet place just the two of us and writing haywire reviews about having sex in different cars 
- i love deep looking into your eyes and remember the amount of chaos we have behind our story and how i wish i could stop time now to genuinely enjoy the moment we're having in this flight
- i love how you're such a good opponent for any puzzle you really want to develop/be part of
- i love how you're the only one who actually proposes solutions that would make me utterly happy in a way and level nobody ever did in my whole existence but i will never ever screw your life up so i will always pretend there is not a good enough solution because i just want you to be happy with your own choices; if you were/are the only one capable of doing it, thus you're undoubtedly the one who deserves the MOST to be untroubled, carefree and happy
- i love how you care about unexpected things i also care about
- i love how i feel comfortable around you, your family, all around your existence and presence
- i love the way you drive
- i love how our bodies fit by design as we were drew by the same creator and ended up finding each other but were premeditated to supply the same features to different people, instead of each other's
- i love hugging you or sitting on your lap with no underwear when you're absolutely unaware of it so i can feel your clothes and keep imagining what if we met on another occasion and that could be the most of you i would ever touch and you would never ever know how close i actually felt your body
- i love how you try to make me not to focus too much in the future but you're forsooth thinking about it twice as me, just trying not to end the present because you know it's too good to be true and even better to last forever but that's the biggest difference between us; i couldn't endure praying to a false god even if it makes me feel faithful. once i acknowledge the hazard of the non-existence of this god, my faith goes dropping and dropping. i'm in advance sorry for this.
