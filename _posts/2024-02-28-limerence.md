it's nearly criminal to say i've never dreamt about all this. but the few times i did, my brain forthwith kicked out any delusional shadow of belief because i'm aware any situation amid yours would bring me some [actually probably a lot of] suffering and eventual ending(s). then i learned about limerence and was sure it's not the case... til i realized: within this postulation: _"typically includes intrusive, **melancholic thoughts, or tragic concerns for the object of one's affection** as well as a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and to have one's feelings reciprocated."_. well, by fetching today our interactions from the beginning, i noticed it was too late since the very fucking first second we talked. the "tragic concerns for the object of one's affection" hurtfully dash and dash and dash and dash; but the crash ? i'm shattered by not knowing what or when.
i find myself unable to drift into slumber without the comforting presence of your warm legs nestled against mine (or behind). it's akin to a child who keeps a gentle hold on their mother's hair or hands, awakening instantly when the reassuring texture or warmth of their grasp is relinquished, dispelling the cocoon of sleep's protective embrace -- the act of sleeping can be only pursued if a safety car is paving the bed. once the safety car departs, so does the sense of security; so does the baby's sleep; and then he wakes up. when i wake up from this dreamy sleep per the departure of my safety car, will i be able to run back on track?
