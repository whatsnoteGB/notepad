I guess that I eventually bumped into programming at a given point in my life and realized that this is the most applicable / appropriate thing that fits or matches my profile, due to the way my brain works

Like my procedural form to remember things, totally oriented by patterns, the mnemonic behind it and finding out that a computer works in a very similar way was a huge relief for me

I guess that I "talk" to computers like normal humans talk to each other, and this is also related to my disorders, like the obsession with numbers, patterns, routines, logic and understanding

People usually don't know much about the stuff I like, but I love to see the reason behind everything and their respective impacts and relations
