Red flags are raising aside the sun ever since I heard about this wave but I took the duty with grace because money and home are the only damn thing I'm sure to be over my control forever.
  
How long will take for all this to become a red flag or if they are real since now, how long will i take to realize it? 
   
Anyway nothing better in my pocket but to ride this riddle...  
  
I need it. I'll be a victim of it for as long as I need it or as long as I endure... if I leave early, I might not be shielded enough. There is no more space for regrets and guilt.
  
Smells like capitalism spirit...
