Simplesmente, como tudo, acredito que qualquer coisa é ![trop beau pour être vrai] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHGAO0hcKkA). 
Não acredito em quase nada; não porque acho que são inverdades mas penso que são omissões e sabendo que não tenho coragem de cavar (porque não quero descobrir e lidar), então como sempre estarei fadada a viver comendo minha própria garganta --- sufocando, agonizando, esperando o pior a cada 5 minutos --- e consigo voltar a viver isso depois de tantos anos de paz?
