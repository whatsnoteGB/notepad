Simplesmente como todas as coisas, sem exceção, tudo é [trop beau pour être vrai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHGAO0hcKkA).  
Não acredito em quase nada; não porque acho que são inverdades mas penso que possuem omissões e sabendo que não tenho coragem de cavar (porque não quero descobrir e muito menos lidar),  seguirei fadada a viver comendo minha própria garganta --- sufocando, agonizando, esperando o pior a cada 5 minutos --- eu consigo mesmmo voltar a viver isso depois de tantos anos de paz?

### taylor current best fittin statements from midnights whole album:
##### (almost the same order i listened to):
  
  
* _i wait patiently he's gonna notice me, it's okay we're the best of friends. anyway._
* _i didn't choose this town, i dream of getting out_
* _sometimes i wonder which one will be your last lie_
* _just to learn that you never care_
* _i don't start shit but i can tell you how it ends_
* _familiarity breeds contempt_ 
* _i keep my side of the street clean, you wouldn't know what i mean_
* _they said the end is coming; everyone s up to something, i find myself running home to your sweet nothings_
* _the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned: you and i ended up in the same room at the same time_
* _i'm only cryptic and machiavellian cause i care_
* _cursed you as i sleep talked_
* _maybe it's the past that's talking screamin from the crypt, tellin me to punish you for things you never did; so i justified it_
* _somewhere in the haze, got a sense i'd been betrayed_
* _every single thing i touch becomes sick with sadness_
* _you were bigger than the whole sky, you were more than just a short time_
* _it's not meant to be, so i'll say words i don't believe (in)_
* _no i didn't but thanks though; i m so in love that i might stop breathing, drew a map on your bedroom ceiling. no i didn't see the news cause we were somewhere else_
* _i want to brainwash you into loving me forever_
* _put your records and regret meeting me_
* _do i really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?_
* _you know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love; the slowlest way is never loving them enough_
* _do i really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?_
* _a brief interruption, a slight malfunction; i'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing, i thought we had no chance_
* _and i damn sure never would've danced with the devil_
* _memories feel like weapons_
* _you made me feel important and then you tried to erase us; you re a crisis of my faith_
* _the wound wont close, i keep on waiting for a sign_
* _i regret you all the time_
* _never take advice from someone who's falling apart_
* _i pictured you with othre girls, in love, then threw up on the street_
* _each bar plays our song, nothin has ever felt so wrong_
* _life is emotionally abusive_
* _time can't stop me quite like you did_
* _when the morning came we were cleaning incense off ur vinyl shelf cause we lost track of time again laughing w my feet in your lap like you were my closest friend_
* _how'd we end up on the floor anyway?_
* _how the hell did we lose sight of us again?_
* _i feel you no matter what_
* _when you splashed your wine into me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks so scarlet it was maroon_
* _and i wake w your memory over me, that's a real fucking legacy to leave_
* _i should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, i ended up in crises_
* _i wake up screaming from dreaming one day i'll watch as you'r leaving cause you got tired of my scheming for the last time_
* _i'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror_
* _tonight feels impossible_
* _i see the great escape; i picked the petals, he loves me not. something different bloomed_
* _he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain_
* _i broke his hear cause he was nice_
* _i don't remember who i was before you painted all my nights a color i've searched for since_
* _but one thing after another, fucking situations, circumstances, miscommunications and i have to say,by the way, i just may like some explanations. can i ask you a question?_
* _did you leave her house in the middle of the night?_
* _do you wish you could still touch her?_
* _i'm on my vigilante shit again_
* _i made you my world, have you heard i can reclaim the land?_
* _never trust it if it rises fast_
