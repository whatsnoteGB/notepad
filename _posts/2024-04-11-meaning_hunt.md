as i grapple with the profound ache of abandonment, retracing the ephemeral footsteps of this fleeting passion, a stark realization washes over meâ€”the shallowness of those words, the dearth of depth in your *expressions of love*. 
everybody can watch the indifference in dropping out of your eyes.
meanwhile Devotion, it seems, was a solitary seed that grew within me, nurtured by the soil of this commitment.

u spoke of life's uncertainties as your reason for withdrawal, yet i foolishly believed this time would be different - a futile hope born from an **imbalance** that was, and remains, the truth.
nevertheless, a flame of determination fueled a resolve to seek depth and meaning in all my endeavors, even as i acknowledge the futility of such pursuits // i'm giving up, they'll be empty now, it's always all in vain.

in a moment of devastating clarity i remember: i'm aware all my heartache will only end with me. i'm the only onw who holds, hugs and squeeze it to the last drop.
i bid you farewell and release u from the burden of my senseless existence, completely imbalanced with ur feelings/expectations, you can now chase around for a real life meaning, hunt a purpose, seek your destinyy. all i want [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7nmB20qJv4) you to be happy.
