as i grapple with the profound ache of abandonment, retracing the ephemeral footsteps of this fleeting passion, a stark realization washes over me â€” the shallowness of those words, the dearth of depth in your *expressions of love*.   
everybody scans the indifference popping on your eyes.  
meanwhile Devotion, it seems, was a solitary seed that grew within me, nurtured by the soil of this commitment.  
{: .text-justify}  
u spoke of life's uncertainties as your reason for withdrawal, yet i foolishly believed this time would be different - a futile hope born from the **imbalance** that was, and remains, the truth.  
nevertheless, a flame of determination fueled a resolve to seek depth and meaning in all my endeavors, even as i acknowledge the futility of such pursuits // i'm giving up, they'll be empty now, it's all always in vain.  
{: .text-justify}  
in a moment of devastating clarity i remember: i'm aware all my heartache will only end up with me. i'm the only one who holds, hugs and squeeze it to the last drop.  
i bid you farewell and release u from the burden of my senseless existence, completely imbalanced with ur feelings and expectations, will do my best so you can chase around a real life meaning, hunt a purpose, seek your destiny.  
all i want [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7nmB20qJv4) you to be happy in the name of us all. ya r worth it.

>>> *"like a dog needs to hunt, people seek meaning. they wither away without it"*
