i desperately try to relieve myself about being so mentally slaved to you - as a property you never asked for (and trying to convince myself that the other way round could be at least a little bit true, e.g hoping you would crave at some level the same from me) - relying on the indelicate thought that parts of your memories would be mine forever throught little illusions i have concerning the fantasies where i expect to be an exception. 
in rational moments, i am aware that any quick or easy gesture you extend to me is likely dwarfed by the efforts you invested in the others. if you did something quick or easy for me, then i know you did longer and more for someone else. 
you're the type that doesn't solve things when you think you have all the time to solve it. *no clock ticking. everyone will be alive and at any given time you'll be able to express yourself and solve it at your manner and place.* just like my father. and sometimes just like me. well, maybe everyone works this way. when you see time is ticking and it's ending, you value it, and see no boundaries to reach solutions for those you appreciate. 
{: .text-justify}  
but while you judge there's a huge time remaining, you sustain in your mind it's optional to solve, then you treat as whatever, and inevitably will end as whatever. 
{: .text-justify}  
any good or bad thing i try to attach us doesnt seem to affect you. even the unexpected souvenir i attempted to create when i asked you to stick your tongue on my bunghole. but just as you did it to me, you will do it to anybody else that you `I.` like or `II.` feel someway coerced to or `III.` even unwittingly, not knowing which hole you're into `IV.` in order to take revenge against me for some reason (which would be a betrayal at this point since we're together and even if we're not, we have the 6-months-after-last-contact commitment to notify and expound about each other's both love and sexual's life) or `IV.` doing it for the purpose of showing to yourself an overcome about your germs-fear.
i don't even know which of these was the case this time. i'm not even aware how many more items/reasons could be there.  
Now, I am filled with dread, knowing that you may be repulsed by these thoughts and that I may have provided you with yet another fresh reason to despise me.
{: .text-justify}  
i'm often invalidated or feel clowning, showing how i feel over stuff you will never show as well - a fool for expressing emotions over matters you will likely never reciprocate, simply because you are incapable of experiencing them. **it's not your fault if you don't feel it.** your fault starts on the *lack of communication* about it. not the *lack of feeling* it. i know you also feel insecure about being this sincere and screwing the whole thing up. but i swear, things will be worse if you keep it for you. 
{: .text-justify}  
all I wanted was in such a short period of time creating something that would be unique and unforgettable between us. yet, seems i'm ill-fated to not be correspondended for eternity. so what is the point of persisting, showing devotion, when it is never returned, not even in words? i keep being consumed by the existence and potential future and the potential not-future and everything else, not being able to concentrate on my stuff anymore, not being able to talk to my friends, my family. extremely affected by it. productivity grounded on the floor. 
{: .text-justify}  
and knowing i'm just one more woman, should i give you the freedom to look for something more suitable? i'm less and less what you were looking for, so why i'm degenerating my mind 24/7 after we met, while i know in little time this is won't be enough for you?
{: .text-justify}   
Desperate struggling to free my mind from the chains of my thoughts, I have at least this thing to write on while you go forward.
