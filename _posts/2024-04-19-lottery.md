As a result, they are preoccupied. So, the males have to vie for attention."_]  
Things are not different for humans. Men keep beseeching attention. The new element is the ego presence. A man's ego is bigger than any woman or reproduction purpose. Here lies the explanation for their instability. They beg for attention to fulfill their egos, not to match females.

Contradictorily, we have absolute primal-men whom point their decisions on instincts and they don't even care about real human race evolution. Their egoistic grounds just aim to **spread** their _trashy, defective and sick genes_, no matter what. This leads to _monkeys_ that desperately wants to produce descendents in disregard of how bad the world political/economical context is or how flawed/deficient those men's genes are. Not to mention the father/mother lack of presence in some predicted cases.

It's always either too much conscience - thus the death of heritage culture -, either a desperation still less efficient (to not say dumb...) than a normal evolution provided by wild animal's reproduction. I pity the victims of hu-**man**-ization. Earth is fucked with you, bad-genes spreaders. Good luck for those who will stay and try. Good job for those who abdicated being one more stupid monkey producing sick kids hoping they would fix something.
