sentences and dialogs from the past keep re-rising from different people everywhere.
a circle or a cycle, it's all the same. same words. same answers. same avoidings. same behavior. same impositions. same disposition. same approach. same manipulations. just different excuses to justify around the same arguments and violence.
the answer for everything concerning third-party scenes [e.g not my authorship] in my life SHOULD be guided by NNN: nothing. never. nobody.
it's still hard for me to keep it straight forward and not deviate from it. that's my key weakness.
i'm unbeliaveble in complete denial of what i'm living, even though i literally had the opportunity to:
- before yesterday >> READING the future i'm about to be submitted in the present  
- yesterday >> LISTENING the future i'm about to be submitted in a very near present  
- today >> WATCHING  [during a dream] the future from which i'm already receiving uproars since NOW
  
why do i still keep blinded in denial of what i'm giving in and up?  
   
i'm tired of being subdued, puny, debilited.  
never capable of choosing things in my favor.  
always a blackbird, slave of others' conveniences. 
half-life lost persuing little oblivious wills and never standing up for a plan/project i schemed myself.
  
the cycle of fake hopes that the current one thing or person will add up to my well-being while i'm the one joining the person's plan thus giving up on mine:  
my weekend. 
my related-ones birthdays. 
my work.
my trips. 
my aspirations.
my life. 
distinct scales of decisions.
either little, medium or big things; i'm always the one giving up in favor of the others.  
judged my mom for doing this her whole life while i keep doing every day the same mistake under the sheets. 
  
when will i collect sturdiness to keep myself up (will i, actually ?) instead of being smashed and serve as ladger and support for someone else and never finished anything i aim? 
my desired to become something drops and drops every time i'm prunned and cut about my plans.  
guess it's time to recalculate my life-end spendings since i'm faded to this weakness and clearly will never get rid of it. 
  
hope at least i'm able to end this shitty life of mine the way i always intended to. that would be my one, only and last successful achievement. however better this last one than none.
